# Data Job Application Automation

## üöÄ Project Summary

The **Data Job Application Automation Tool** is a desktop application designed to streamline the job application process. It uses AI to extract key details from a job posting URL, and then uses that information to generate a customized resume and cover letter from your templates.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Web Scraping:** Extracts job details (position, company, skills, etc.) from a provided URL using **Selenium**.
-   **AI-Powered Data Extraction:** Uses **OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)** to parse the scraped text and extract structured information.
-   **Document Generation:** Populates your `.docx` resume and cover letter templates with the extracted job details.
-   **File Organization:** Automatically creates a new folder for each application, containing the customized documents.
-   **Application Tracking:** Appends a record of each scraped job to a central `tracker.csv` file.
-   **Simple UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface built with **Tkinter**.
